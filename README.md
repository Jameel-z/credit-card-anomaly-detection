# Credit Card Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

This project was completed for the BLACKBOX AI 24-hour ML Challenge. It uses unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## 🔍 Objective
Detect anomalies in credit card transactions and evaluate results using ROC-AUC and visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Sample size used: 5,000 rows (stratified sampling)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Google Colab
- scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## 🧠 Model
- Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results
- ROC-AUC: `xx.xx`
- Precision: `xx.xx`, Recall: `xx.xx`
